Car Resale value Prediction

   Both buyers and sellers might benefit from being able to forecast the market value of used cars. Many people have an interest in the used automobile market at some point in their lives when they need to sell or purchase a vehicle. It's a risky move to pay too much or sell something for less than it's worth throughout this procedure. In this project, we'll use a variety of features, like the year, model type, brand, fuel type, and kilo-meter, to forecast the price of used cars. The current system involves a procedure where a vendor chooses a price arbitrarily and the buyer is unaware of the car and its current market value. In actuality, the seller is equally unaware of the car's market value or the amount he ought to ask for it. We have created a model that will be quite effective in resolving this issue. Gaining gradient Because it calculates the discrepancy between the current forecast and the known correct target value, regressors are used. As a result, it will be feasible to forecast the exact cost of an automobile rather than its price range. A user interface that accepts input from any user and displays the price of a car based on their inputs has also been developed.
